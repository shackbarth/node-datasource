FUTURE REFACTORING POSSIBILITIES
errors return 200 with isError: true. Better to return 500?
the routes could declare their paths. Is the indirection worth the modularity?
we should put these under test
unify response formatting (DONE! TODO: clean up the client datasource so as not to have to service them both)
deprecate databasetype === 'global'
